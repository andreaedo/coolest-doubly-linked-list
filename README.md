# The Coolest Doubly Linked List


Note: this code is uploaded on a private github repo, if necessary access can be provided.

The aim of this work was to create a data structure that mimics a doubly-linked-list logic, wrapped in a library that can be published as an npm package.

As requested, no dependencies have been used, exeption made for 'Jest', installed as a dev-dependency and used for testing.

Code is documented in-line with a jsdoc-like style, however the jsdoc was not actually generated to avoid installing the dependency. 
Using this approch I intended to show how it could have been possible to properly document even a so simple piece of code.
